    "description" : "van de Laar 2011: Three pathogenic SMAD3 mutations associated with aortic dissection/aneurysm were described in independent families.  One mutation was a 2bp deletion leading to a frameshift and premature termination at exon7 (removing nearly all of the MH2 oligomerization domain).  This mutation segregated faithfully in 22 family members, though not all reported aortic involvement.  The truncated mutant message was shown to be sensitive to nonsense-mediated RNA decay, suggesting a haploinsufficiency mechanism.  The other two mutations described were substitution mutations of highly conserved residues in the MH2 domain.  See also PMID: 22167769 for a second publication from this group with mutliple additional nonsense, frameshift, and missense mutation described."

    "description" : "Regalado 2011: Four novel SMAD3 mutations in independent families were shown to segregate with aneurysm phenotypes (aortic, cranial).  One frameshift mutation segregating in a large family was found in exon 5, which would remove all of the MH2 domain (supporting a haploinsufficiency, rather than dominant negative mechanism).  Three other substitution mutations were described; two in the MH2 domain.  "

    "description" : "Hilhorst-Hofstee 2012: A large deletion described in multiple family members.  This deletion involves all but exon 1 of SMAD3 (plus two additional genes).  The proband also had a 22q11.2 duplication (related to indication for study), but further family follow-up revealed the SMAD3 deletion in multiple adult family members with aortic aneurysms.  While this deletion does involve AAGAB and IQCH in additon to SMAD3, it is consistent with the phenotypes in the SMAD3-only mutation cases.  Plus, the large deletion supports haploinsufficiency as the mechanism for pathogenicity.  "

  "description" : "Multiple mutations in SMAD3 have been shown associated with syndromic aortic aneurysms and dissections (Loeys-Dietz, type3).  While no full gene deletions were found in the current literature search, multiple nonsense and frameshift mutations as well as partial gene deletions have been described.  Haploinsufficiency as well as disruption of trimer formation due to specific MH2 domain mutations have been implicated as genetic mechanisms."
